I'm starting up a new blog that I'm going to commit to. After reviewing several options, I've decided to go with the static site generator Hugo. It's written in Go, and seems to have many features I want, including being fast. Not that being fast will matter at first.

I'm going to use one of the existing themes for Hugo at first, but eventually I would like to create my own.
