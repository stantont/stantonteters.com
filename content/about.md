I'm Stanton Teters, a software developer in New York. I've been working for a financial services company for the past twelve years doing Java, .NET, and JavaScript for the most part, with a smattering of Python and Perl for scripts.

Before that I worked for the consulting company Quidnunc till shortly before it bit the dust.

Prior to Quidnunc I worked in publishing for a few years at Penguin.
